What's four word sentence that will immediately turn off your ability to think? "Say something about yourself" + similiar sentences. 
There is not much to write. I am here because I would like to learn better programming practices and also work my way toward machine-learning. I have created this account because I have few fun ideas of implementing my knowledge of Information Theory, Stat&Prob and a tiny  bit of knowledge I have about Game Theory.
